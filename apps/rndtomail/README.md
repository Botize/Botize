## Sample application: Random to Mail ##

Random to Mail (application id: rndtomail) is a simple example that demonstrates the basic features of a Botize application. Namely:

- There is one trigger that produces one sentence randomly chosen from a list previously configured by the user.
- There is one action that allows sending one email message.
- Botize authentication is required. User is "theBotize!", password is "thePassword!". 
- Credentials based user authentication is required. Username is "theUser!", password is "thePassword!".
- Both the trigger and the action have a function configuration form.
- It is possible to send a test email from the action configuration form, this is done by using the _form\_request_ command.

See the Botize API documentation and the source code of the application itself for more details.
